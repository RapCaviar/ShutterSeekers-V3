# ShutterSeekers-V3

Greetings everyone,

I am thrilled to announce the development of an exciting new app designed specifically for photographers. Our app will help photographers discover and capture iconic landmarks and picturesque locations through recommendations and reference photos shared by fellow enthusiasts. This will not only enhance your photography experiences but also enable you to gauge the quality of composition at these locations.

Currently, we have successfully implemented the image upload feature and demonstrated the integration with Google Maps. With your support, we aspire to create a valuable resource for photographers and tourists alike, enabling them to create lasting visual memories.

Thank you for joining this community and supporting our mission. If you are interested in contributing to the coding aspect of the project, please react to this message, and I will update your role to 'coder,' granting you access to specialized chats.

Together, we can turn this vision into reality.

Changes required: 1-make location to be named first 2-integrate post functionality 3-change design so more bette UX 4-transfer to a server base instead of local storage
